# Hello
Hi

### Math demo
Finally, we can calculate the output voltage of the circuit using this finalvoltage divider. But be careful! All the voltage dividers we have seen so farhave been connected to ground. This one goes between $V_{dd}$ and$\frac{5}{8}V_{dd}$ instead. This means that we have to modify our formula a little.

Remember how we came up with the formula? We said that as you travel along thresistor, you are dropping your voltage from $V_{dd}$ down to ground. Well, inthis case we are not dropping all the way to ground. So instead of taking thefraction of the drop and multiplying by $V_{dd}$, let's multiply by the totalvoltage drop. In this case, it's $V_{dd} - \frac{5}{8}V_{dd} = \frac{3}{8}V_{dd}$. That gives us the amount ofvoltage the output is _above_ the lower-voltage node. So in order to get the actual output voltage, we need to add the voltage of the lower node as well.

So our overall voltage divider formula for this circuit will be $\frac{5}{8}V_{dd} + \frac{R}{2R + R} * \frac{3}{8}V_{dd} = \frac{3}{4}V_{dd}$.

This is shown slide.
