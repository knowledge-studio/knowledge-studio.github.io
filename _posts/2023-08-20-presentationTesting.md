# Great Title

[comment]: # (A comment starting with three or more !!! marks a slide break.)
[comment]: # (!!!)

This is a sample presentation to showcase [markdown-slides](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides). The source markdown file is [presentation.md](https://gitlab.com/da_doomer/markdown-slides/-/blob/master/example/presentation.md).

Use markdown to harness the power of Reveal.js.

## Lists and math

- Using markdown to write presentations
- Easy lists
- LaTeX math syntax

`$$ J(\theta_0,\theta_1) = \sum_{i=0} $$`

Code syntax highlighting and animations:

```js [1-2|3|4]
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = x => 1 + 2 + x;
c(3);
```

Notice the background color change.

[comment]: # (section attributes for the just-ending slide can be specified:)
[comment]: # (!!! data-background-color="aquamarine")

Use background videos, background pictures and **text formatting**,
everything *without breaking* your markdown files.

[comment]: # (Other background options: https://revealjs.com/backgrounds/)
[comment]: # (!!! data-background-video="https://knowledge-studio.github.io/posts/presentation/media/video.mp4", data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted data-background-opacity="0.2")

Even speaker notes, accessed through the `S` key on your keyboard.

(You may have to allow pop-up windows and try again.)

Note:
This will only appear in the speaker view! ðŸ¤¯
